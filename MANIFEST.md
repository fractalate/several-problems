# Manifest

This document outlines special files which are added to support each of the languages used in
this project. My hope is that this listing will help others sort through all the unfamiliar
files from languages they may not have used before.

## Files for Rust

* [Cargo.lock](./Cargo.lock)
* [Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml)
* [.gitignore](./.gitignore)
